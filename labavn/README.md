##Possible Usage
Build a tracking and notification system, which notifies you when certain proposals are open. You can add an ability to
easily fill out the forms to submit the bid and track your documents.

If we can aggregate procurement requests from multiple city sources, it will be very beneficial for many suppliers.
You can build a subscription service charging suppliers to get notified.


We can build a quick beautiful landing page of a product and request emails for people interested in such a service.
A few blog posts analyzing the types of requests can be written up to get traffic for the landing page.
